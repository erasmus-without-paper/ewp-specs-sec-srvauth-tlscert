Release notes
=============

This document describes all the changes made to the *Authenticating Servers
with TLS Certificate* document, starting from its first released version.


1.0.0
-----

This document was created as a result of splitting the Architecture and
Security document into a number of separate smaller documents. This document
was already stable (version 1.7.0) before it has been split, and the "meaning"
of this "child" document has not been modified much, so we made it stable
(1.0.0) immediately.

It's worth noting however, that - while the *meaning* remained the same - the
*wording* changed substantially, to accommodate the terms introduced by the
new multiple authentication and encryption methods.
